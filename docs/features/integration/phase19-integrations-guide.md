# Phase 19 — Integrations & Data Import: Product Requirements

## Document Purpose

This document defines the product requirements, user experience, and business value for Trussen integrations. It is organized by sub-phase and written for product managers, designers, and engineers who need to understand what to build, why, and what users should experience — not how to implement it technically.

# Phase 19a — GitHub Integration

## Why Teams Need GitHub Integration

Engineering teams live in two worlds: the project management tool where work is planned and tracked, and GitHub where work is actually done. Without integration, these worlds are disconnected.

**The daily pain without GitHub integration:**

A developer finishes a feature. They push code, open a pull request, get it reviewed, and merge. Then they have to open Trussen, find the issue, move it to "Done", and maybe paste the PR link in a comment. They forget half the time. The PM checks the board and sees "In Progress" on something that shipped two days ago. Trust in the board erodes. Standups become status interrogations instead of forward-looking conversations.

**Who benefits:**

| Role | Benefit |
|---|---|
| **Engineers** | Never manually update issue status again. Work flows naturally from branch → commit → PR → merge → done. |
| **Engineering Managers** | See real delivery velocity, not self-reported status. Know which PRs are blocking which issues. |
| **Product Managers** | Trust the board. When something shows "Done", it means code was merged, not that someone clicked a button. |
| **Designers** | See when their design specs are actually being implemented and when the PR is ready for review. |
| **Founders/Stakeholders** | Track engineering output without asking for updates. Board accuracy eliminates "where are we?" meetings. |

## Connection Experience

### Initial Setup

When an ADMIN or OWNER opens **Settings > Integrations**, they see a card for each available provider. The GitHub card shows:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  GitHub                                          [Connect]   │
│                                                              │
│  Link your GitHub repositories to automatically track        │
│  branches, commits, and pull requests on your issues.        │
│                                                              │
│  ✓ Auto-link commits and PRs to issues                      │
│  ✓ Auto-update issue status when PRs merge                  │
│  ✓ See development progress directly on issue cards          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Clicking **Connect** opens GitHub's authorization page. The user selects which organization and repositories Trussen can access. After authorization, the user returns to Trussen and sees:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  GitHub                                       [Connected ✓]  │

│  [Manage Repositories]  [Settings]  [Disconnect]             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Repository Selection

After connecting, the admin selects which repositories should be linked to the workspace. Only selected repositories will have their activity tracked.

The repository picker shows:

```

## Developer Workflow

This is the core value of GitHub integration — making the developer's existing Git workflow automatically update Trussen.

### Step-by-Step Example

**The issue:**

```
LIN-24  Fix login crash on iOS Safari
Status: Todo
Priority: High
Assignee: Shaheer
Project: Mobile App
```

**Step 1: Developer creates a branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/LIN-24-fix-login
```

Trussen detects the branch name contains `LIN-24` and shows on the issue:

```
Development
  🌿 feature/LIN-24-fix-login  created just now by Shaheer
```

The issue remains in "Todo" — creating a branch is not starting work (the developer might be exploring). No status change.

**Step 2: Developer commits**

```bash
git commit -m "LIN-24 fix login crash on iOS Safari"
```

After pushing, Trussen shows on the issue:

```
Development
  🌿 feature/LIN-24-fix-login  created 1 hour ago
  📝 abc1234 "LIN-24 fix login crash on iOS Safari"  pushed just now
```

Activity feed entry:

```
Shaheer pushed a commit referencing this issue
abc1234 — "LIN-24 fix login crash on iOS Safari"
acme/mobile-app · feature/LIN-24-fix-login
2 minutes ago
```

**Step 3: Developer opens a pull request**

```
Title: LIN-24 Fix login crash on iOS Safari
Branch: feature/LIN-24-fix-login → main
```

Trussen detects `LIN-24` in the PR title and:
1. Links the PR to issue LIN-24
2. Moves issue status from "Todo" to "Review" (if auto-move is enabled)
3. Sends notification to the assignee: "PR #142 opened for LIN-24"

The issue now shows:

```
Development
  🌿 feature/LIN-24-fix-login
  📝 abc1234 "LIN-24 fix login crash on iOS Safari"
  🔀 PR #142 "LIN-24 Fix login crash on iOS Safari"
     Open · 0 of 2 reviews · No conflicts
     acme/mobile-app · feature/LIN-24-fix-login → main
```

Activity feed:

```
Shaheer opened a pull request for this issue
PR #142 — "LIN-24 Fix login crash on iOS Safari"
acme/mobile-app
5 minutes ago

Trussen moved this issue to Review
Triggered by PR #142 being opened
5 minutes ago
```

**Step 4: PR is reviewed**

A teammate approves the PR on GitHub. Trussen shows:

```
Development
  🔀 PR #142 "LIN-24 Fix login crash on iOS Safari"
     Open · 1 of 2 reviews approved · No conflicts
```

Notification to PR author: "Ali approved PR #142 for LIN-24"

Activity feed:

```
Ali approved pull request #142
acme/mobile-app
10 minutes ago
```

**Step 5: PR is merged**

The PR is merged on GitHub. Trussen:
1. Updates PR status to "Merged"
2. Moves issue LIN-24 from "Review" to "Done" (if auto-complete is enabled)
3. Sets `completedAt` timestamp
4. Sends notification to assignee: "LIN-24 completed — PR #142 merged"

The issue now shows:

```
Development
  🔀 PR #142 "LIN-24 Fix login crash on iOS Safari"
     Merged · 2 reviews approved
     acme/mobile-app · merged into main
```

Activity feed:

```
PR #142 was merged into main
LIN-24 automatically moved to Done
acme/mobile-app
just now
```

### How Issue References Are Detected

Trussen recognizes `LIN-XXX` in:
- Branch names: `feature/LIN-24-fix-login`, `bugfix/LIN-24`, `LIN-24-hotfix`
- Commit messages: `"LIN-24 fix login crash"`, `"Fixes LIN-24"`, `"closes LIN-24"`
- PR titles: `"LIN-24 Fix login crash"`
- PR descriptions: `"This PR fixes LIN-24 and LIN-25"`

Multiple issue references in a single PR are supported — a PR can link to `LIN-24`, `LIN-25`, and `LIN-26` simultaneously.

## Issue Experience

When GitHub activity is linked to an issue, a **Development** section appears on the issue detail page:

## Team Benefits

- **Zero context switching** — developers never leave their terminal or GitHub to update Trussen
- **Accurate project status** — the board reflects reality because it's driven by code activity, not manual clicks
- **Accountability without micromanagement** — managers see progress through automated signals, not standups
- **Faster code review** — reviewers see the full issue context (description, acceptance criteria, designs) linked from the PR
- **Sprint velocity accuracy** — completion is tied to actual merges, making velocity metrics trustworthy
- **Onboarding** — new team members see the full history of an issue including all code changes

## What Is NOT Included

| Not Included | Reason |
|---|---|
| Repository management (create, delete, settings) | GitHub is the source of truth for repository configuration |
| CI/CD pipeline management | Out of scope — use GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc. directly |
| Code review within Trussen | GitHub's review experience is superior and established |
| Source code viewing or editing | Trussen is not an IDE or code browser |
| GitHub Issues sync (bidirectional) | Phase 19a is one-directional: GitHub activity → Trussen. Bidirectional sync adds complexity without clear value for teams already using Trussen as their primary tracker |
| GitHub Projects board sync | Teams should choose one board: Trussen or GitHub Projects, not both |
| Automatic branch creation from Trussen | Nice-to-have for future. In Phase 19a, developers create branches themselves with the `LIN-XXX` naming convention |

**GitHub remains the source of truth for code. Trussen remains the source of truth for work planning.**

---

# Phase 19b — Slack Integration

## Why Teams Need Slack Integration

Slack is where teams communicate. Trussen is where teams plan. Without integration, important work updates get buried in Slack threads that no one can find later, and issue status updates require leaving a conversation to open another tool.

**The daily pain without Slack integration:**

A PM asks in #engineering: "What's the status of the login fix?" Three people respond with different levels of detail. Someone says "I think it's done?" Someone else says "PR is open." Nobody is sure. The PM opens Trussen to check. The board says "In Progress" because nobody remembered to update it.

Meanwhile, the on-call engineer gets paged about a production issue. They create the issue in Trussen, but nobody in #incidents knows about it. They have to post in Slack separately, creating duplicate information that will drift apart.

**Who benefits:**

| Role | Benefit |
|---|---|
| **Everyone** | Important updates appear where the team already is — Slack |
| **PMs** | Get project updates in Slack without checking Trussen constantly |
| **Engineers** | Create and manage issues without leaving Slack |
| **Engineering Managers** | See cycle completions, blockers, and urgent issues in team channels |
| **Remote Teams** | Async-friendly: updates post to channels automatically regardless of timezone |

## Workspace Connection Experience

## Team Benefits

- **Visibility without effort** — important updates show up where the team already communicates
- **Faster incident response** — urgent issues immediately appear in #incidents
- **Quick actions from Slack** — create issues, check status, view sprint progress without opening Trussen
- **DM notifications** — personal notifications reach you even when you're not in Trussen
- **Async-friendly** — channel posts create a timeline of project progress that any timezone can catch up on
- **Meeting reduction** — automated cycle summaries and project completions replace many status meetings

## What Is NOT Included

| Not Included | Reason |
|---|---|
| Full issue management in Slack | Slack is a companion, not a replacement for Trussen. Complex workflows (drag to reorder, bulk edit, roadmap planning) belong in the app |
| Bidirectional comment sync | Comments posted in Slack do not create comments in Trussen. Reply in Trussen when you need the context preserved |
| Slack channel creation/management | Trussen does not manage your Slack workspace structure |
| File sharing through Slack | Use Trussen attachments for project files |
| User provisioning from Slack | Team membership is managed in Trussen, not derived from Slack channels |

**Slack acts as a companion experience — a notification destination and quick-action surface. Trussen remains the source of truth for all project data.**

# Phase 19c — Figma Integration

## Why Teams Need Figma Integration

Design and development are sequential: designs are created first, then implemented. The handoff between these two phases is where information gets lost. Developers open an issue, see "Implement login page redesign," and have to go hunting for the Figma link. They find three different versions across Slack, email, and a Google Doc. They implement the wrong one.

**Who benefits:**

| Role | Benefit |
|---|---|
| **Designers** | Designs are linked to the work they inform. No more "which Figma file is the latest?" |
| **Developers** | Open an issue, see the design right there. No hunting, no guessing |
| **PMs** | Ensure design specs are attached to issues before development starts |
| **QA** | Compare implementation against the linked design, not a screenshot from 3 weeks ago |

## Designer Workflow

### Linking Designs to Projects

A designer working on the Mobile App project opens the project in Trussen and navigates to the **Designs** tab:

```

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### Linking Designs to Issues

When creating or editing an issue, a designer can paste a Figma URL and Trussen automatically creates a rich link:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LIN-50  Redesign checkout flow                              │
│                                                              │
│  Design Reference                                            │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │  ┌───────────┐                                       │   │

│  │  └───────────┘                                       │   │
│  │                 [Open in Figma]                       │   │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                                              │
│  Description                                                 │
│  Redesign the checkout flow based on the updated design...   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Design Preview Experience

When a Figma link is attached to an issue, Trussen displays:

- **Thumbnail preview** — a visual snapshot of the linked frame/page
- **File name** — "Checkout Flow v2"
- **Project name** — "Mobile App Designs"
- **Last modified** — "Jun 8, 2026" with modifier name
- **Frame count** — how many frames/pages in the file (if applicable)
- **Open in Figma** — direct link to the exact frame in Figma

Clicking the preview opens a larger preview modal within Trussen. Clicking "Open in Figma" opens the file directly in Figma.

## Collaboration Benefits

- **Single source of design truth per issue** — no more "which mockup are we implementing?"
- **Design review in context** — developers see the design alongside the acceptance criteria and technical requirements
- **Progress tracking** — PMs can see which issues have designs attached and which are still waiting
- **QA accuracy** — testers compare implementation against the actual linked design, not a screenshot
- **Design history** — since Figma shows "last modified," the team knows if the design has changed since development started

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## What Is NOT Included

| Not Included | Reason |
|---|---|
| Design editing within Trussen | Figma is the design tool. Trussen is a link and preview surface. |
| Design file management | No creating, deleting, or organizing Figma files from Trussen |
| Design version comparison | Use Figma's built-in version history |
| Design-to-code export | Out of scope for a project management tool |
| Real-time design sync | Thumbnails are fetched on demand, not continuously synced |
| Design review/approval workflow | Use Figma's comment and annotation features |

**Figma remains the source of truth for design. Trussen provides the bridge between design intent and development execution.**

# Phase 19d — Discord Integration

## Why Teams Use Discord

Many engineering teams, open-source communities, and startups use Discord as their primary communication platform. Discord is particularly popular with:

- **Open-source projects** that want community visibility into development progress
- **Gaming and creative studios** already using Discord for team communication
- **Small startups** that prefer Discord's free tier over Slack's paid plans
- **Developer communities** building products with engaged user bases

## Workspace Connection Experience

Connecting Discord uses a bot-based approach. The admin adds the Trussen bot to their Discord server and selects notification channels:

## Team Benefits

- **Community transparency** — open-source contributors see progress in real-time
- **Free-tier friendly** — Discord's free plan has no message limits
- **Low-friction setup** — bot-based connection, no OAuth complexity for team members
- **Channel flexibility** — route different notification types to different channels

## What Is NOT Included

| Not Included | Reason |
|---|---|
| Slash commands in Discord | Phase 19d is outbound-only. Slash commands may be added later |
| Direct messages | Discord DMs are not used for personal notifications — use the Trussen inbox |
| Bidirectional sync | Discord messages do not create or modify Trussen data |
| Thread management | Discord threads are not linked to Trussen issues |
| Voice channel integration | Out of scope for project management |

**Discord acts primarily as a notification destination — a one-way broadcast channel for workspace events.**

# Phase 19e — Data Import

## Why Teams Need Importing

Teams switch project management tools for many reasons: the current tool is too complex (Jira), too limited (Trello), too expensive (Asana at scale), or the team simply wants a better experience (migrating to Trussen).

The biggest barrier to switching is the migration cost. Teams have months or years of project history, hundreds or thousands of issues, carefully organized labels, sprint data, and team structures. Starting from zero is not an option.

**Without import capability:**
- Teams must manually recreate every project, issue, and label
- History is lost — no context on past decisions, no audit trail
- Sprint velocity data resets — no baseline for planning
- Adoption stalls because the "just try it" cost is too high

**With import capability:**
- Teams import their existing data in minutes, not weeks
- Hit the ground running with full history intact
- Zero disruption to ongoing work — import over lunch, switch the next morning
- Decision to try Trussen becomes low-risk: "if we don't like it, we haven't lost anything"

## Supported Sources

| Source | What Teams Use It For |
|---|---|
| **Linear** | Engineering teams migrating from Linear's issue tracker |
| **Jira** | Enterprise teams moving away from Jira's complexity |
| **ClickUp** | Teams that outgrew ClickUp's "everything app" approach |
| **Asana** | Product/design teams switching to an engineering-focused tool |
| **Trello** | Teams graduating from Trello's card-based simplicity |

## Migration Experience

### Step 1: Select Source

The admin opens **Settings > Import Data** and sees:

```

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 2: Authenticate

After selecting a source (e.g., Linear), the admin authorizes Trussen to read their Linear workspace. This uses read-only access — Trussen never modifies the source.

### Step 3: Preview

Trussen fetches the source workspace data and shows a preview:

```

## Team Benefits

- **Zero-friction migration** — switch to Trussen without losing months of project history
- **Preserve institutional knowledge** — comments, discussions, and decisions travel with the issues
- **Accurate velocity from day one** — imported sprint data gives meaningful baselines
- **Low-risk trial** — import your data, try Trussen for a week, decide without fear of data loss
- **Gradual migration** — import one team's projects first, expand once the team is comfortable

## What Is NOT Included

| Not Included | Reason |
|---|---|
| Ongoing synchronization | Import is a one-time migration, not continuous sync. After import, Trussen is the source of truth. |
| Export back to source | Trussen does not export data back to Linear/Jira/etc. |
| Attachment migration (Phase 19e v1) | File attachments are referenced but not re-uploaded in the initial version. URLs are preserved. |
| User account creation | Import matches members by email. Users not in Trussen must be invited separately. |
| Custom field migration | Source-specific custom fields are preserved in issue metadata but not displayed as first-class fields |
| Webhook/integration migration | Source tool integrations (e.g., Linear's GitHub integration) are not migrated |

**Importing is a one-time migration event, not ongoing synchronization. After import, Trussen becomes the single source of truth.**

## Summary — Integration Priorities

| Phase | Provider | Type | Priority | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 19a | GitHub | Live integration | Highest | Core engineering workflow. Every engineering team uses Git. |
| 19b | Slack | Live integration | High | Most common team communication tool. Notifications and quick actions. |
| 19c | Figma | Link integration | Medium | Design-dev handoff. Read-only, low complexity. |
| 19d | Discord | Notification | Medium | Important for open-source and startup teams. Outbound-only, simple. |
| 19e | Data Import | Migration | High | Unblocks adoption. Teams cannot switch without their data. |

Recommended build order: **19a → 19e → 19b → 19c → 19d**

GitHub and import unblock adoption. Slack adds ongoing value. Figma and Discord are enhancements.
